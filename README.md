# Adrian Garcia SE333 Assignment 5

[![SE333_CI](https://github.com/adriangarciao2/assignment5/actions/workflows/SE333_CI.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/adriangarciao2/assignment5/actions/workflows/SE333_CI.yml)

Each class (DeliveryPrice, ExtraCostForElectronics, and RegularCost) was tested using two approaches. 
Specification-based testing checks that each class behaves correctly according to its requirements, like DeliveryPrice 
returning 5 for 1–3 items or ExtraCostForElectronics adding 7.50 when there’s an electronic item. Structural-based 
testing ensures all branches and paths in the code are covered, such as each if/else condition. Together, these tests
confirm correct behavior and full logic coverage.

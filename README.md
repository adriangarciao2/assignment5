In this project I set up automated testing and continuous integration for the provided Amazon system. It includes 
specification-based, structural-based, and integration tests using JUnit and Mockito to verify core
functionality and behavior. The workflow was created to automatically run the tests, Checkstyle, and JaCoCo
coverage on each commit, ensuring the project builds and reports results successfully.
